Things that change depending on if we're in the learning or test phase

	TrialNumber (how should I deal with this?)
	moduleProgress
		records guesses (related to option inversion)
		if we're in the test phase, the progress variable should always be 3
		Also if we're in the test phase it shouldn't give feedback, but that makes sense because of the way the feedback works. Might have to put an "if" branch so that if we're not in testing the progress var will increment but otherwise it won't

	main.vizOrder (order of visualizations/which variable we ask about)
		This ideally shouldn't even be calculated in the test phase to avoid confusion. But even if it is, the render function should ignore it






Things that are the same for both phases (set it and forget it)
	
	main.Set (which svg set we're dealing with)
	main.varPlacement (which variable is X1, Y, and X2)
		If I change the order of the svg functions and other things in the beginning, I shouldn't have to ever think about this again, right?

	Data (ideally): this should be determined at the beginning. Should just append the base dataset to include the testing data.
		The basic render function should be written so that it can deal with the 0123 coding, so a 3 overrides the variable placement randomization, etc.

	option inversions
	timer

	main.row: at the start of the phase the learning data and test data should be randomized separately from the vars in the backend, then spliced together (make sure the test data starts where the learning data ends!)

	main.TrialProbabilities: should have probabilities for both the learning and test data, have to put these in for test data
